<h2>What is a Percentage?</h2>
The word "percentage" comes from the Latin "per centum," meaning "by the hundred." A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. It's represented by the percent sign (%). When we say 50%, we mean 50 out of 100, or 50/100, which simplifies to Â½.
Percentages are everywhere in daily life:
<ul>
    <li>Sales and discounts in stores</li>
    <li>Interest rates on loans and savings accounts</li>
    <li>Battery charge indicators on devices</li>
    <li>Nutrition information on food packaging</li>
    <li>Test scores and academic grades</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Basic Percentage Formula</h2>
The fundamental percentage formula is straightforward:
<div class="formula">
    Percentage = (Part / Whole) Ã— 100
</div>
Where:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Part</strong> is the portion of the whole you're interested in</li>
    <li><strong>Whole</strong> is the total or complete amount</li>
    <li>The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example 1: Calculating a Test Score</h3>
    Suppose you answered 45 questions correctly out of 60 on a test. What percentage did you score?
    Using the formula:
    Percentage = (45 / 60) Ã— 100 = 0.75 Ã— 100 = 75%
</div>

<h2>Different Types of Percentage Problems</h2>
While the basic formula remains the same, percentage calculations can be categorized into three main types:
<h3>1. Find the Percentage of a Number</h3>
This is when you want to know what a certain percentage is of a given number.
<div class="formula">
    Result = (Percentage / 100) Ã— Number
</div>
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 2: Calculating a Discount</h4>
    A $200 jacket is on sale for 25% off. What's the discount amount?
    Discount = (25 / 100) Ã— 200 = 0.25 Ã— 200 = $50
    Sale price = $200 - $50 = $150
</div>
<h3>2. Find What Percentage One Number Is of Another</h3>
This is the standard percentage calculation we saw earlier.
<div class="formula">
    Percentage = (Part / Whole) Ã— 100
</div>
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 3: Calculating Battery Percentage</h4>
    Your phone shows 3,450 mAh remaining out of a 4,000 mAh battery. What percentage remains?
    Percentage = (3,450 / 4,000) Ã— 100 = 0.8625 Ã— 100 = 86.25%
</div>
<h3>3. Find the Whole When the Percentage Is Known</h3>
This is useful when you know a part and what percentage it represents of the whole.
<div class="formula">
    Whole = Part / (Percentage / 100)
</div>
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 4: Determining Total Sales</h4>
    A salesperson made $8,400 in commission, which is 7% of their total sales. What were their total sales?
    Total sales = 8,400 / (7 / 100) = 8,400 / 0.07 = $120,000
</div>
<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Percentages</h2>
Let's break down the percentage calculation process into simple steps:
<ol>
    <li><strong>Identify the part and the whole:</strong> Determine which number represents the portion and which represents the total.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide the part by the whole:</strong> This gives you a decimal number between 0 and 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiply by 100:</strong> Convert the decimal to a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the percent sign:</strong> Don't forget to include the % symbol to indicate it's a percentage.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Common Percentage Conversions</h2>
It's helpful to memorize some common percentage conversions:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Fraction</th>
        <th>Decimal</th>
        <th>Percentage</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/2</td>
        <td>0.5</td>
        <td>50%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/4</td>
        <td>0.25</td>
        <td>25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3/4</td>
        <td>0.75</td>
        <td>75%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/5</td>
        <td>0.2</td>
        <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/10</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
        <td>10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1/100</td>
        <td>0.01</td>
        <td>1%</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<h2>Calculating Percentage Increase and Decrease</h2>
Percentages are often used to measure changes. The formula for percentage change is:
<div class="formula">
    Percentage Change = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] Ã— 100
</div>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example 5: Calculating Price Increase</h3>
    A product's price increased from $80 to $100. What's the percentage increase?
    Percentage Increase = [(100 - 80) / 80] Ã— 100 = (20 / 80) Ã— 100 = 0.25 Ã— 100 = 25%
</div>
<div class="example">
    <h3>Example 6: Calculating Population Decrease</h3>
    A town's population decreased from 12,000 to 11,400. What's the percentage decrease?
    Percentage Decrease = [(11,400 - 12,000) / 12,000] Ã— 100 = (-600 / 12,000) Ã— 100 = -0.05 Ã— 100 = -5% (or 5% decrease)
</div>
<h2>Practical Applications of Percentage Calculations</h2>
<h3>1. Financial Calculations</h3>
Percentages are crucial in finance for calculating:
<ul>
    <li>Interest rates on loans and savings</li>
    <li>Investment returns</li>
    <li>Mortgage payments</li>
    <li>Credit card APRs</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 7: Calculating Simple Interest</h4>
    You deposit $5,000 in a savings account with a 3% annual interest rate. How much interest will you earn in one year?
    Interest = (3 / 100) Ã— 5,000 = 0.03 Ã— 5,000 = $150
</div>
<h3>2. Shopping and Discounts</h3>
Understanding percentages helps you:
<ul>
    <li>Calculate sale prices</li>
    <li>Compare discounts</li>
    <li>Determine final prices after markdowns</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 8: Stacked Discounts</h4>
    An item originally priced at $200 has a 20% discount, plus an additional 15% off the sale price. What's the final price?
    First discount: (20 / 100) Ã— 200 = $40 â†’ Sale price = $160
    Second discount: (15 / 100) Ã— 160 = $24 â†’ Final price = $136
</div>
<h3>3. Statistics and Data Analysis</h3>
Percentages help interpret data by:
<ul>
    <li>Showing proportions in surveys</li>
    <li>Calculating growth rates</li>
    <li>Comparing parts to wholes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tips for Solving Percentage Problems</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Always identify what represents 100%:</strong> This is your baseline for comparison.</li>
    <li><strong>Convert percentages to decimals when multiplying:</strong> Move the decimal point two places left (25% becomes 0.25).</li>
    <li><strong>Convert decimals to percentages when presenting results:</strong> Move the decimal point two places right (0.35 becomes 35%).</li>
    <li><strong>Use the percentage formula triangle:</strong> Cover the variable you want to find to see which operation to perform.</li>
    <li><strong>Check your answers:</strong> Does the result make sense in context?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Common Percentage Calculation Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
Even with a simple formula, errors can occur. Watch out for these common mistakes:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Confusing the part and the whole:</strong> Always double-check which number represents the total.</li>
    <li><strong>Forgetting to multiply by 100:</strong> This leaves you with a decimal instead of a percentage.</li>
    <li><strong>Misplacing decimal points:</strong> Especially when converting between percentages and decimals.</li>
    <li><strong>Adding percentages of different wholes:</strong> Percentages can't be added unless they relate to the same base amount.</li>
    <li><strong>Assuming percentage points and percentages are the same:</strong> A 5% increase from 10% is 10.5%, not 15%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced Percentage Concepts</h2>
Once you've mastered basic percentage calculations, you can explore more advanced applications:
<h3>1. Compound Percentage Changes</h3>
When multiple percentage changes occur sequentially, they don't simply add up.
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 9: Compound Interest</h4>
    You invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded yearly for 3 years.
    Year 1: 1,000 Ã— 1.05 = $1,050
    Year 2: 1,050 Ã— 1.05 = $1,102.50
    Year 3: 1,102.50 Ã— 1.05 = $1,157.63
    The total growth is 15.76%, not 15%, due to compounding.
</div>
<h3>2. Percentage Points vs. Percentages</h3>
A percentage point is an absolute unit (1% = 1 percentage point), while a percentage change is relative.
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 10: Interest Rate Increase</h4>
    If an interest rate rises from 4% to 6%:
    â€¢ The increase is 2 percentage points
    â€¢ The percentage increase is (6-4)/4 Ã— 100 = 50%
</div>
<h3>3. Reverse Percentages</h3>
Finding the original amount when you know the final amount and the percentage change.
<div class="example">
    <h4>Example 11: Original Price After Discount</h4>
    A shirt costs $56 after a 30% discount. What was the original price?
    $56 represents 70% of the original price (100% - 30%)
    Original price = 56 / 0.70 = $80
</div>
<h2>Percentage Calculation Tools and Resources</h2>
While understanding the manual calculation is important, several tools can help:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Percentage calculators:</strong> Online tools that automate the calculations</li>
    <li><strong>Spreadsheet functions:</strong> Excel and Google Sheets have built-in percentage functions</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile apps:</strong> Many math apps include percentage calculators</li>
    <li><strong>Printable worksheets:</strong> For practicing percentage problems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Percentages</h2>
<h3>Q: How do I calculate 20% of a number?</h3>
