        <h2>What is a Percentage? Understanding the Basics</h2>
        <p>The word "percentage" comes from the Latin "per centum," meaning "by the hundred." A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. It's represented by the percent sign (%). When we say 50%, we mean 50 out of 100, or 50/100, which simplifies to ½.</p>
        
        <h3>Where We Use Percentages in Daily Life</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopping:</strong> Sales and discounts in stores</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Interest rates on loans and savings accounts</li>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Battery charge indicators on devices</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Information on food packaging</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Test scores and academic grades</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How to Calculate Percentage: The Fundamental Formula</h2>
        <p>The basic percentage formula is essential for all percentage calculations:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
        </div>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Part:</strong> The portion of the whole you're interested in</li>
            <li><strong>Whole:</strong> The total or complete amount</li>
            <li><strong>Multiply by 100:</strong> Converts the decimal to a percentage</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Calculating a Test Score Percentage</h3>
            <p>If you answered 45 questions correctly out of 60 on a test, here's how to calculate your percentage score:</p>
            <p>Percentage = (45 / 60) × 100 = 0.75 × 100 = <strong>75%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>3 Main Types of Percentage Calculations</h2>
        
        <h3>1. How to Find the Percentage of a Number</h3>
        <p>Use this when you want to know what a certain percentage is of a given number.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            Result = (Percentage / 100) × Number
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example: Calculating a Discount Amount</h4>
            <p>A $200 jacket is on sale for 25% off. What's the discount amount?</p>
            <p>Discount = (25 / 100) × 200 = 0.25 × 200 = <strong>$50</strong></p>
            <p>Sale price = $200 - $50 = <strong>$150</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. How to Find What Percentage One Number Is of Another</h3>
        <p>This is the standard percentage calculation we saw earlier.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example: Calculating Battery Percentage</h4>
            <p>Your phone shows 3,450 mAh remaining out of a 4,000 mAh battery. What percentage remains?</p>
            <p>Percentage = (3,450 / 4,000) × 100 = 0.8625 × 100 = <strong>86.25%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. How to Find the Whole When the Percentage Is Known</h3>
        <p>Useful when you know a part and what percentage it represents of the whole.</p>
        <div class="formula">
            Whole = Part / (Percentage / 100)
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example: Determining Total Sales from Commission</h4>
            <p>A salesperson made $8,400 in commission, which is 7% of their total sales. What were their total sales?</p>
            <p>Total sales = 8,400 / (7 / 100) = 8,400 / 0.07 = <strong>$120,000</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Calculate Percentages</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the part and the whole:</strong> Determine which number represents the portion and which represents the total.</li>
            <li><strong>Divide the part by the whole:</strong> This gives you a decimal number between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiply by 100:</strong> Convert the decimal to a percentage by moving the decimal point two places to the right.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the percent sign:</strong> Include the % symbol to indicate it's a percentage.</li>

        <h2>How to Calculate Percentage Increase and Decrease</h2>
        <p>The formula for percentage change is:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            Percentage Change = [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] × 100
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Calculating Price Increase Percentage</h3>
            <p>A product's price increased from $80 to $100. What's the percentage increase?</p>
            <p>Percentage Increase = [(100 - 80) / 80] × 100 = (20 / 80) × 100 = 0.25 × 100 = <strong>25%</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example: Calculating Population Decrease Percentage</h3>
            <p>A town's population decreased from 12,000 to 11,400. What's the percentage decrease?</p>
            <p>Percentage Decrease = [(11,400 - 12,000) / 12,000] × 100 = (-600 / 12,000) × 100 = -0.05 × 100 = <strong>-5%</strong> (or 5% decrease)</p>

        <h2>Tips for Solving Percentage Problems</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify what represents 100%:</strong> This is your baseline for comparison.</li>
            <li><strong>Convert percentages to decimals when multiplying:</strong> Move the decimal point two places left (25% becomes 0.25).</li>
            <li><strong>Convert decimals to percentages when presenting results:</strong> Move the decimal point two places right (0.35 becomes 35%).</li>
            <li><strong>Use the percentage formula triangle:</strong> Cover the variable you want to find to see which operation to perform.</li>
            <li><strong>Check your answers:</strong> Does the result make sense in context?</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Common Mistakes When Calculating Percentages</h2>
        <p>Watch out for these common errors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confusing the part and the whole:</strong> Always double-check which number represents the total.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting to multiply by 100:</strong> This leaves you with a decimal instead of a percentage.</li>
            <li><strong>Misplacing decimal points:</strong> Especially when converting between percentages and decimals.</li>
            <li><strong>Adding percentages of different wholes:</strong> Percentages can't be added unless they relate to the same base amount.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Advanced Percentage Calculations</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Compound Percentage Changes</h3>
        <p>When multiple percentage changes occur sequentially, they don't simply add up.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example: Compound Interest Calculation</h4>
            <p>You invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded yearly for 3 years.</p>
            <p>Year 1: 1,000 × 1.05 = $1,050</p>
            <p>Year 2: 1,050 × 1.05 = $1,102.50</p>
            <p>Year 3: 1,102.50 × 1.05 = $1,157.63</p>
            <p>The total growth is <strong>15.76%</strong>, not 15%, due to compounding.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Reverse Percentage Calculations</h3>
        <p>Finding the original amount when you know the final amount and the percentage change.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Example: Finding Original Price After Discount</h4>
            <p>A shirt costs $56 after a 30% discount. What was the original price?</p>
            <p>$56 represents 70% of the original price (100% - 30%)</p>
            <p>Original price = 56 / 0.70 = <strong>$80</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Q: How do I calculate 20% of a number?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Multiply the number by 0.20 (which is 20/100). For example, 20% of 150 is 150 × 0.20 = 30.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: How do I add a percentage to a number?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Multiply the number by (1 + percentage as a decimal). To add 15% to 200: 200 × 1.15 = 230.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: How do I subtract a percentage from a number?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Multiply the number by (1 - percentage as a decimal). To subtract 20% from 500: 500 × 0.80 = 400.</p>
        
        <h3>Q: Why do we multiply by 100 in percentage calculations?</h3>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> Multiplying by 100 converts the decimal fraction to a percentage, which is easier to understand and compare (e.g., 0.25 becomes 25%).</p>
